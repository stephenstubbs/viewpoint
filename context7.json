  "projectTitle": "Viewpoint - Rust Browser Automation",
  "description": "A Rust-native browser automation library inspired by Playwright. Provides high-level API for controlling Chromium browsers via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) with support for element locators, assertions, network interception, and test fixtures.",
  "rules": [
    "Use `viewpoint-test` as the primary crate for testing. It re-exports `viewpoint-core` types.",
    "Create a `TestHarness` for automatic browser setup/cleanup. Call `TestHarness::new().await?` to get started.",
    "Use `page.goto(url).goto().await?` for navigation. The builder pattern allows configuring wait states.",
    "Use `page.locator(selector)` to find elements. Locators auto-wait before performing actions.",
    "Prefer semantic locators: `get_by_role()`, `get_by_label()`, `get_by_test_id()`, `get_by_text()`.",
    "Use `expect(locator).to_be_visible().await?` for assertions. All assertions auto-wait.",
    "Use `page.route(pattern, handler)` for network interception and mocking.",
    "The `js!` macro validates JavaScript at compile time. Use `#{expr}` for value interpolation.",
    "Browser contexts are isolated (like incognito). Use `browser.new_context()` for isolation.",
    "Actions like `click()` auto-wait for navigation. Use `.no_wait_after(true)` to opt out."
